source,target,type,severity,notes
d1,d4,pharmacodynamic,moderate,"both thin blood, increasing bleeding risk"
d1,d5,pharmacodynamic,high,"NSAIDs like ibuprofen increase bleeding risk with warfarin"
d1,d6,pharmacokinetic,low,"may slightly reduce statin levels"
d2,d5,pharmacodynamic,moderate,"acetaminophen in high doses may enhance warfarin effect"
d3,d5,pharmacodynamic,high,"NSAIDs increase bleeding risk when combined with warfarin"
d4,d5,pharmacodynamic,high,"aspirin plus warfarin greatly increases bleeding risk"
d5,d6,pharmacokinetic,low,"statins can alter warfarin metabolism"
d6,d11,pharmacokinetic,moderate,"azithromycin may raise statin levels causing muscle pain"
d6,d16,pharmacokinetic,low,"omeprazole can alter statin absorption slightly"
d7,d9,pharmacodynamic,moderate,"beta blockers can mask low blood sugar symptoms from insulin"
d8,d9,pharmacodynamic,moderate,"metformin and insulin both lower blood sugar"
d8,d16,pharmacokinetic,low,"omeprazole may change metformin absorption"
d9,d13,pharmacodynamic,low,"sedatives can worsen insulin-related hypoglycemia"
d10,d11,pharmacodynamic,moderate,"using two antibiotics may increase stomach upset"
d10,d16,pharmacokinetic,low,"omeprazole can slightly reduce antibiotic effect"
d11,d12,pharmacodynamic,moderate,"antibiotics may affect serotonin levels with SSRIs"
d12,d13,pharmacodynamic,high,"mixing SSRIs and benzodiazepines increases sedation risk"
d12,d16,pharmacokinetic,low,"omeprazole can change SSRI absorption"
d13,d14,pharmacodynamic,low,"mild additive drowsiness"
d13,d15,pharmacodynamic,low,"slight increase in heart rate effects"
d14,d15,pharmacodynamic,low,"no major risk but both affect airways slightly"
d14,d16,pharmacokinetic,low,"omeprazole can slow antihistamine breakdown"
d1,d2,pharmacodynamic,low,"safe combo but both affect liver in high doses"
d4,d6,pharmacodynamic,low,"statins and aspirin mildly increase muscle risk"
d5,d16,pharmacokinetic,moderate,"omeprazole can increase warfarin levels"
d6,d7,pharmacodynamic,low,"beta blockers and statins mildly affect heart rhythm"
d7,d13,pharmacodynamic,moderate,"can increase sedation or dizziness"
d8,d12,pharmacodynamic,low,"SSRIs can affect blood sugar regulation"
d12,d15,pharmacodynamic,low,"SSRI may alter heart rhythm slightly with albuterol"
d15,d16,pharmacokinetic,low,"omeprazole may alter albuterol absorption slightly"
d1,d18,pharmacodynamic,high,"Ibuprofen blocks the kidney-protective and BP-lowering effects of lisinopril; can cause acute kidney injury."
d5,d17,pharmacodynamic,high,"Thyroid hormone increases the breakdown of clotting factors, significantly boosting warfarin's effect and bleeding risk."
d5,d21,pharmacodynamic,moderate,"Rosuvastatin can enhance the anticoagulant effect of warfarin, requiring more frequent blood tests (INR) to avoid bleeding."
d12,d25,mixed,high,"zyban raises sertraline levels (Kinetic) and both drugs lower the seizure threshold (Dynamic)."
d9,d22,pharmacodynamic,moderate,"Both lower blood sugar via different pathways; taking them together significantly increases the risk of hypoglycemia"
d4,d18,pharmacodynamic,moderate,"Like ibuprofen, aspirin can reduce the effectiveness of lisinopril and potentially strain the kidneys."
d8,d22,pharmacodynamic,low,"A common therapeutic pairing, but the additive effect on the GI tract (nausea/diarrhea) can be difficult to tolerate initially."
d18,d20,pharmacodynamic,high,"Both target the same blood pressure system; using them together causes high potassium and severe kidney stress."
d16,d17,pharmacokinetic,moderate,"Omeprazole reduces stomach acid; without enough acid, the thyroid pill cannot dissolve or absorb into the body correctly."
d7,d23,pharmacodynamic,moderate,"Both slow the heart or relax vessels; combined they can cause an excessively slow heart rate or very low blood pressure."
